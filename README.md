# ShallowBeThyGraves

Shallow Be Thy Graves is a game made in a week for a game jam. The game is written in GDScript on top of the Godot game engine. Download it here: https://freshouttathebag.itch.io/shallow-be-thy-graves

Shallow Be Thy Graves has been adapted to Godot's C# implementation and is still being developed to this day (although development is slow since I have to finish up school ðŸ˜‰)
